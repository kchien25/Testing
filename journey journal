why did i choose to change my career path? well, that's easy. actually, looking back, 
it was easy but when i was making the decision, it was pretty damn hard. i really 
thought about it for days, weeks, months, and it just really clicked for me when i 
realized that i never went out of my way to self study things related to biology or 
medicine or anything like that but taking online courses on computer science was just 
genuinely fun and interesting to me. even watching a couple videos on SQL and unix 
command lines were pretty fun for me although i'm learning those things quite casually 
when compared to the other courses that i'm taking online. i really just think that 
everything about this subject is endlessly interesting while biology... was actually 
my least favorite science in college. my favorite science was organic chemistry 
followed by general chemistry. i would have gone into chemistry rather than biology 
back then but at that time, i hated math. i actually like math a lot more now after 
taking calc 1 and calc 2.

also, i just wanted to say that i installed eclipse, apache maven, made code runner 
work on vscode yesterday and the day before and that was so frustrating. maven was so 
frustrating. thank goodness for homebrew.

i discovered codewars today! it's pretty fun! they're like little challenges. my python 
skillz have deteriorated though i'm learning a lot from the solutions that are on 
there! i didn't even know replace and filter was a thing. also, i changed my profile 
picture on github because i was told that professional people would actually be looking 
at them so using a picture of the guy from america's next top model isn't good. 

p.s. i should learn what agile is
p.p.s. it's a software development method that lets you update in small bunches rather 
than a huge shabang all at once

today was a pretty great day! dr. leader connected me with the development team at 
jefferson and they're going to let me shadow some of the team members there. they work 
on applications, patient portals, websites, and much more. i feel like this would be 
really helpful with determining what direction i want to go with programming and if 
software development really is where my passion lies. i'm excited!!

also, i've started watching the webcasts from berkeley and stanford and i guess for 
now i'll focus on that and maybe put the websites as a low priority because web 
development isn't really what i WANT to do anyway though javascript is a very useful 
language nonetheless. i just find python cleaner, easier to use, and easier to keep my 
thoughts in order. i suppose using more comments on javascript would help level the 
playing field, though.
