so this is where i'm going to just keep myself and maybe others who are interested 
organized and informed on what i've done and not done in concerns to computer science

today is 2/21/18 and i just decided not too long ago, maybe 4/5 days, that i wasn't 
going to go to medical school and instead i'm going to go into software development. 
web development is also interesting but i don't think that's where my passion lies. of 
course, since i'm not too well informed about these things, yet, i suppose i can't be 
too sure but for now, i'll be working towards software development. i plan to finish my 
master's in public health, however. it could be useful to me if i wanted to go into a 
healthcare related company.

some may think that my bachelor's in biology and master's in public health is a shame 
and a waste but it absolutely is not. regardless of the material i learned, i also 
gained many invaluable skills along the way including skills in critical thinking, logic, 
communication, data gathering and analysis, and much more.

online courses i've taken:
(c - completed, ip - in progress, h - on hold)

1. c - edx.org - logic and computational thinking
2. c - edx.org - introduction to python: absolute beginner
3. c - edx.org - introduction to python: fundamentals
4. c - edx.org - designing a technical solution
5. c - edx.org - building interactive prototypes using javascript
6. ip - ucberkeley - cs61a - structure and interpretation of computer programs
7. h - edx.org - building functional prototypes using node.js - on hold because... just because
8. h - ucberkeley - ee16a - designing information devices and systems 1 - on hold because i bit off more than i could chew with my master's program :'(
9. c - edx.org - learn to program in java
10. ip - edx.org - object oriented programming in java
